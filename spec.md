## General Specs for Manga Viewer

Insight into how each component works together to allow for seamless manga reading. May be helpful if anyone else is looking into the MangaDex API and doesn't know where to begin (or is lost on something).

Most of the more advanced features (and general usability features) are locked behind Authentication, which is done via MangaDex. Therefore, a MangaDex account is required.

To authenticate, head over to [the authentication page](/auth.html) and enter in your MangaDex credentials (email & password). Once you submit your credentials, they are sent via the API to https://api.mangadex.org/auth/login. The API will then send back a session token and a refresh token.

This refresh token can then be periodically used every **14 min** to refresh your current session via https://api.mangadex.org/auth/refresh.

Your current session can be viewed in the [settings page](/settings), using https://api.mangadex.org/user/me to get your current user information.

### <i class="icon w-24" data-feather="book"></i> Reading

> Related: [read.js](/js/read.js)

Reading manga is done via the MangaDex@Home network, using https://api.mangadex.org/at-home/server/{chaptierid} to start. From there, a chapter hash, a base URL, and a data-type is retrieved and allows for a re-construction of the URL. Each URL is generated by MangaDex for your individual session, and cannot be sent to others after a set amount of time.

eg. https://abcdefg.hijklmn.mangadex.network:12345/some-token/data/e199c7d73af7a58e8a4d0263f03db660/x1-b765e86d5ecbc932cf3f517a8604f6ac6d8a7f379b0277a117dc7c09c53d041e.png (as per documentation)

The current manga and chapter is done via URL parameters (or queries), specified below:

- `?m=74088ca4-48ea-4c09-8df0-2943708b1c0c` The manga's ID.
- `?c=e81d4141-c28a-409c-9c60-3e2b4fba9a9e` The manga's chapter ID.

eg. read.html?c=e81d4141-c28a-409c-9c60-3e2b4fba9a9e&m=74088ca4-48ea-4c09-8df0-2943708b1c0c

MangaDex allows for a data-quality to be specified, either `data` (highest), or `data-saver` (lower quality). This can be changed in the [settings](/settings), listed under "Prefer low quality downloads" (enabling will opt for data-saver).
